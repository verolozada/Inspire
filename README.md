Inspire resulted from a desire to "do good" and to "be impactful". Often, technology is built to benefit us as individuals. Sure we have apps that can help us find dates, book cheap flights, and play games but software can be used for so much more. Our goal for Inspire is to use its technology to raise awareness on how people can give back and impact the world.

The purpose of Inspire is to allow users the opportunity to create, update, and delete content surrounding information about non-profits and charitees. Not only do they have the opportunity to create content, they will also be able to research and read up on other non-profits of their interest.
